## About
The Hangman Game is a classic word guessing game that challenges players to unravel a secret word. The task is to guess the word by guessing a letter one at a time. However, be careful! If you guess an incorrect letter, you will lose a life, and a body part of the hangman figure will be drawn.

Prepare yourself to get focused. Whether you choose to play solo or in a group, the Hangman Game guarantees hours of fun while at the same time expanding your vocabulary!

2. It then displays inputs to give assurance to the user that the game has started. ![Game has started](documentation/features/)
3. It then displays the text ''You have 6 lives'' which is the default lives (guessing chances) the user will start with. ![You have 6 lives](documentation/features/)
4. It also displays the hangman figure, that at the moment is only a pole. ![Hangman stage 1](documentation/features/)
5. Underneath the hangman stages, underscores will be displayed, the number of underscores is the number of letters. Each underscore represents a hidden letter. For example, _ _ _ would be a word containing three letters. ![Underscores for secret letter](documentation/features/)
6. Underneath that the user is presented with an input field. "Guess a letter:" The user should then type their first guess. ![Input field](documentation/features/) 
- If the guess suggested would be anything other than a single letter. The user will get a message saying "Invalid guess! Please enter a single letter. If the user does write anything other than a letter, it won't affect the remaining lives. The input field will just repeat itself and the player will have to try again. ![Invalid guess](documentation/features/)
7. If the user guesses an incorrect letter, the first body part (the head of the hangman figure) will be drawn, and the remaining lives will decrease to 5. ![Incorrect guess](documentation/features/)
* Important: If an incorrect letter is guessed once again, a life will be taken, therefore the user has to work on their memory skills/or scroll up to see if they had already guessed that letter.
8. If the user guesses a correct word, the underscore that contains that/or those letters will be filled in. ![Correct guess](documentation/features/)
* The game will continue this way until the user has guessed the correct word or the user has used all of their 6 lives.
* If the user loses. They will get a message saying "YOU LOSE!" and they will, at last, know what the secret word was. ![You lose + The correct word displayed](documentation/features/)

## Features left to Implement

* At the moment, the user has to remember prevouisly guessed incorrect letters. Even though this could be seen as a part of the game (to remember or to scroll up to remind themselves if they had already guessed that letter), I do want to make a collection in the future, displaying all of the words that has already been guessed right next to the input field.

* A custom 404 page

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

* There was an issue with colorama that applied all prints after the recent selected color the same color.

* I fixed it with the help of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u51Zjlnui4Y) video. The solution was to implement a parameter called autoreset=true to the colorama module.

* The bug was solved and afterwards the implementation of colors were handled more effortlessly.
